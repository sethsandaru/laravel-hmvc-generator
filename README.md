# Laravel Search 3 - Seth Sandaru
Tired to build a Search Page for Management or for User using everytime? And in the future, when you want to upgrade/update it, you have to look back the code, read the code, code, blah blah,... It's too much to handle and cost you very much for both of time & money.

Because of that problem, just like the Vue Form Builder. Laravel Search 3 is built to help you to archive that. 

Laravel Search 3 will help you to:
- Build & Config your own Search Page
	- Drag 'n Drop to build the Search Form (Fields to search, lookup,... Conditional Field)
	- Drag 'n Drop to build the Table Result 
- Render the page with full functional by using the **DataTable**.
- Server & Client Event Hooks to help you do deal with your own data problem.
- Easy to use, easy to maintain/upgrade in the future.
- Supported Bootstrap 3 & 4.
